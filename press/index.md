description: Press coverage and reviews of Jerome Faria's work from The Quietus, Bodyspace, Indie Rock Mag, and others.

> "An almost romantic sound that recalls Eno's *Discreet Music*, with the additional creak of wind-up toys and waves of static that seem broadcast from the beach."
> **[The Quietus](https://thequietus.com/articles/07568-madeiradig-festival-review-ktl)**

> "Beautifully twisted chaos unfolding with no respite."
> **[The Devil's Mouth](https://thedevilsmouth.substack.com/p/video-premiere-nox-altar)**

> "Oscillated skillfully between electronic doom and subtle ambient. As if embodying two faces of the same coin—at times liberating, at times punishing, at times meditative, at times abrupt."
> **[Bodyspace](https://bodyspace.net/ao-vivo/1675-william-basinski-mr-herbert-quain-jerome-faria/)**

> "A particular talent for atmospheric progressions, interweaving ethereal instrumentals into an organic and hypnotic movement with the allure of a waking dream."
> **[Indie Rock Mag](https://www.indierockmag.com/article19210.html)**

> "It's almost as if we were contemplating the machine, forced to escape its synthesised perfection, about to stumble upon itself at any moment."
> **[Edição Limitada](https://edicaolimitada.blogs.sapo.pt/)**

> "There is not a second to spare here, nor a moment to throw away."
> **[Ponto Alternativo](https://amplificasom.com/ponto-alternativo/)**
