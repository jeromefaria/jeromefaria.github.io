There's a particular kind of artist who emerges from the netlabel era—someone who came of age when distributing experimental music meant uploading MP3s to servers in distant countries, when community meant forum threads and Creative Commons licenses. Jerome Faria is one of these artists, though to say he emerged from that moment would be to understate what he's done since.

Born in Madeira in 1983, Faria spent his formative years in Switzerland before returning to Portugal as a teenager. Piano and guitar came first, then drums—a rhythmic foundation that would inform even his most abstract work. By 2003, he had moved into electronic music, releasing as NNY through Enough Records, Test Tube, and MiMi. The music was confrontational: digital detritus reshaped into something urgent.

What's remarkable is how quickly Faria moved from internet obscurity to festival stages. By 2005 he was performing at MADEIRADIG, sharing bills with Fennesz and Florian Hecker. He'd return five more times over the following six years, the company growing more formidable: Frank Bretschneider and Vladislav Delay in 2006-07, Alva Noto and Murcof in 2009, then the stacked 2011 lineup—Tim Hecker, Oneohtrix Point Never, KTL, Deaf Center, Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth. That edition saw Faria performing a duo with Taylor Deupree. The Quietus described their collaboration as possessing "an almost romantic sound that recalls Eno's *Discreet Music*."

This wasn't the arc of a local artist occasionally granted access to international stages. Faria was programmed as a peer. The circuit expanded: EME in Lisbon, Störung in Barcelona, Olhares de Outono in Porto, Festival Migractions in Paris. In 2015, he opened for William Basinski in Lisbon. Bodyspace noted that he "oscillated skillfully between electronic doom and subtle ambient—at times liberating, at times punishing, at times meditative, at times abrupt."

The shift from NNY to releases under his own name signaled a turn toward patience. *Overlapse* (Enough Records, 2012) demonstrated new restraint—drones that unfurled gradually, textures requiring sustained attention. Edição Limitada wrote that it felt "almost as if we were contemplating the machine, forced to escape its synthesised perfection, about to stumble upon itself at any moment."

Around this time, Faria began composing for picture. His score for Robert Wiene's *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*—first performed in 2010, eventually self-released on his own BRØQN label in 2023—represents perhaps the deepest expression of his compositional voice. Working against Wiene's angular expressionist nightmare, he created a dialogue spanning a century of sonic possibility, honoring the film's unease while exploring territories the original could never have envisioned. Additional film work includes *Invisible Other* (2016), a meditation on contemporary solitude by Portuguese-Norwegian artist Margarida Paiva, and *Aragão* (2021), a theatre piece celebrating the centenary of António Aragão, one of the founders of Portuguese Experimental Poetry. For the latter, staged at the Teatro Municipal Baltazar Dias in Funchal, Faria provided both original music and live interpretation—embedding himself in a multidisciplinary creative team rather than delivering a score from a distance.

*2504* arrived in 2024 as his most conceptually ambitious work. Released on 25 April—the 50th anniversary of Portugal's Carnation Revolution—the piece lasts precisely 25 minutes and 4 seconds, the revolutionary date written into its duration. It draws on Schaeffer's musique concrète, Radigue's analogue synthesis, and Reich's phasing techniques. The source material comprises archival recordings from before, during, and after the revolution—news broadcasts, speeches, religious celebrations, sports events, advertisements.

Born nine years after the revolution ended decades of dictatorship, Faria belongs to a generation that inherited democracy without knowing its absence. *2504* grapples with that inheritance, neither documentary nor abstraction but something that uses the past as raw material for present-tense experience.

In 2025, *Overlapse XIII* invited eight artists to reimagine his debut album, with Faria as curator and mastering engineer. Contributors include Pedro Pestana of 10 000 Russos (as Tren Go! Sound System), João Vairinhos of LÖBO, and Pedro Roque (as CAVERNANCIA). His inclusion in *Glitch: Designing Imperfection* (Mark Batty Publisher, 2009)—a foundational text on glitch aesthetics—and his work as a university lecturer establish him as both practitioner and theorist. His music has reached NTS Radio's *Fractal Meat On A Spongy Bone*. He remains part of Portugal's experimental scene alongside @c, Vitor Joaquim, and Hugo Olim.

What emerges from twenty years is an artist working in the spaces between—noise and melody, analogue and digital, solo practice and community. In a field where technology promises frictionless production, Faria seeks the grain, the texture, the resistance. The work continues. The frequencies shift. Something is always happening at the margins.
