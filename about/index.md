Jerome Faria is a Lisbon-based composer and sound artist whose work spans experimental electronics, film scoring, and live performance. Born in Madeira in 1983 and raised in Switzerland, he returned to Portugal as a teenager before moving into electronic music in 2003.

## Background

Piano and guitar came first, then drums—a rhythmic foundation that would inform even his most abstract work. By 2003, Faria had begun releasing as NNY through netlabels including Enough Records, Test Tube, and MiMi. The music was confrontational: digital detritus reshaped into something urgent. Between 2004 and 2009, the releases came steadily—*OFFEAR.EP*, *ECT*, *(READ.ERROR)*, *COIL*, *NNY++*, the *Hyphema* DVD—each pushing further into abstraction while retaining compositional rigor.

## The Turn Toward Patience

The shift from NNY to releases under his own name signaled a turn toward patience. *Overlapse* (Enough Records, 2012) demonstrated new restraint—drones that unfurled gradually, textures requiring sustained attention. Around this time, Faria began composing for picture. His score for Robert Wiene's *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*—first performed in 2010, eventually self-released on his own BRØQN label in 2023—represents perhaps the deepest expression of his compositional voice.

## Current Work

In 2024, Faria formed NOx with Pedro Roque of CAVERNANCIA. Their debut *ALTAR* (Colectivo Casa Amarela)—a 33-minute improvisation recorded near a nitric acid factory—marks a return to the rawer energies of his early work. His 2024 release *2504*, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Portugal's Carnation Revolution, draws on Schaeffer, Radigue, and Reich to transform archival material into a meditation on inherited democracy.

Faria remains part of Portugal's experimental scene alongside @c, Vitor Joaquim, and Hugo Olim. His inclusion in *Glitch: Designing Imperfection* (Mark Batty Publisher, 2009) and his work as a university lecturer establish him as both practitioner and theorist. He also works as a mastering engineer for other artists in the scene.
