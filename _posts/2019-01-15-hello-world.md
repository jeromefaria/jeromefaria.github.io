It is not uncommon to start a new year with the misconception that it is a clean slate, but is a new calendar really all that it takes to engage in major changes?

One of my personal resolutions is usually to write more. But to be honest, I lost count of how many times I started the year with an awkward blog post, only to remove it a few months later because either the reality in which it was initially written is no longer relevant, or just because I completely failed at keeping the habit of writing regularly.

The biggest challenge for me has always been to find a worthy subject to write about. "Maybe I can write about programming?" I thought. After all, I am a professional software engineer, and I might have something relevant to share or teach. But with the overwhelming abundance of excellent content available on the web, it can be daunting to get started on a subject that already has such a rich ecosystem of talented people contributing.

I eventually managed to find my voice in another personal passion: music. I began to write short essays about records that I listen to and started to publish them on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jeromefaria), of all places. Over the course of the last 2 to 3 years, I have gathered over 10K followers, and people seem to actually read my short stories about the music that I love.

The most valuable lesson here is that this journey has helped me improve my process of writing, and I feel that the logical next step for me is to try and expand to different subjects, while keeping the discipline of writing consistently, even if it is just about personal themes.
