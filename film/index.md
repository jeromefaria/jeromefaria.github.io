## The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (2010/2023)

Live score for Robert Wiene's 1920 expressionist silent film. First performed in 2010, released on BRØQN in 2023.

Working against Wiene's angular expressionist nightmare, the score creates a dialogue spanning a century of sonic possibility—honoring the film's unease while exploring territories the original could never have envisioned. Represents perhaps the deepest expression of Faria's compositional voice.

## Invisible Other (2016)

Original score for film by Portuguese-Norwegian visual artist Margarida Paiva. Shot at the Jardim Botânico do Porto.

The film depicts a park as a closed world where anonymous characters drift past one another, bound only by gestures and glances. Paiva's work is characterized by poetic narratives exploring existential contemporary solitude.

## Aragão (2021)

Theatre production celebrating the centenary of António Aragão, a founder of Experimental Poetry in Portugal. Staged at the Teatro Municipal Baltazar Dias in Funchal.

Direction by Sara Gonçalves. Text by Rui Zink. Conceived as a performative-sonic-visual event. Faria provided both original music and live interpretation—embedding himself in a multidisciplinary creative team rather than delivering a score from a distance.

Creative team included set designer José Manuel Castanheira and video artist Filipe Ferraz.
