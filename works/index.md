## As Jerome Faria

**2504** — BRØQN, 2024
Released 25 April 2024—the 50th anniversary of Portugal's Carnation Revolution. Duration: 25 minutes and 4 seconds. Five movements drawing on Schaeffer's musique concrète, Radigue's analogue synthesis, and Reich's phasing techniques. Source material comprises archival recordings from before, during, and after the revolution.

**Music Written & Performed for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari** — BRØQN, 2023
Live score for Robert Wiene's 1920 expressionist silent film. First performed in 2010. A dialogue spanning a century of sonic possibility, honoring the film's unease while exploring territories the original could never have envisioned.

**Overlapse** — Enough Records, 2012
A turn toward patience. Drones that unfurl gradually, textures requiring sustained attention.

**-0°** — BRØQN, 2009
First release under own name.
