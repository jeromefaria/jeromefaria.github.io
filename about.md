Hi, I'm Jerome! I Live in Lisbon and I have been working with digital media for the last 20 years, ranging from graphic design to computer music, motion graphics and software development with an interest on generative systems. Recently, I have been focusing primarily on web and mobile application development using modern web technologies.
